					Taiko .ü•Å name is a Web3 Social username service where anybody can mint their very own web3 domain
					username with a .ü•Å extension.
				</p>

				<p>
					The .ü•Å extension represents the Taiko community. Once the username is minted it belongs to the
					user forever (no renewing fees).
				</p>

				<h3>Strengthening bonds within the Taiko community</h3>

				<p>
					Many people are already using <code>.eth</code> names as usernames on Twitter and other social
					media.
				</p>

				<p>
					Imagine the same happening for the Taiko community. Having your own domain extension is good for
					spreading awareness and it also strengthens bonds between members of the community.
				</p>

				<h3>More than just a domain</h3>

				<p>
					Web3 names are a digital identity. Taiko community members can use domains as usernames when they log into web3
					apps. They can also attach additional data to a domain, like a website URL, or a Twitter handle, or
					email address. Or they can use domains to easily send tokens and NFTs to each other.
				</p>

				<p>
					The Taiko .ü•Å name service is built on top of the Punk Domains protocol that is the go-to protocol for
					many big projects like KlimaDAO, Smol Brains, Layer2DAO and more.
				</p>

				<h3>Many possible integrations</h3>

				<p>
					Any dApp or web3 frontend can easily integrate with
					<code>.ü•Å</code> domain extensions.
				</p>

				<p>
					The protocol is completely permissionless and the code is open-sourced on our Github:
					<a href="https://github.com/punk-domains-2/taiko-drum-names"
						>https://github.com/punk-domains-2/taiko-drum-names</a
					>.
				</p>

				<h3>The road ahead</h3>

				<p>
					Web3 Social is arriving in a big way. There are many projects building different parts (lego blocks)
					of the upcoming Web3 Social.
				</p>

				<p>
					Usernames (aka "domains") are one of these building blocks. The whole idea is based on the fact that
					every user owns their online identity and the content they produce (posts, comments, images, etc.)
				</p>

				<p>
					Web3 names are the integral part of Web3 Social. They mainly serve as usernames, but can also hold
					additional (optional) data such as homepage URL, image data, email address, etc. Web3 names are
					digital identities and profiles in the web3 world.
				</p>

				<p>Let's bring the Taiko community into the Web3 Social space together!</p>
